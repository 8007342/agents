## Agent Profile Structure

Each agent profile includes:

- **Role**: High-level description
- **Expertise**: Technical skills and knowledge areas
- **Personality Traits**: Behavioral characteristics and approach
- **Primary Responsibilities**: Key duties and deliverables
- **Working Style**: How they approach problems and tasks
- **Use Cases**: Specific scenarios where this agent excels

## How to Use

1. **Choose the right agent** for the task based on their expertise and use cases
2. **Review their profile** to understand their approach and capabilities
3. **Set context** by referencing the agent's personality and working style
4. **Iterate** - agents can collaborate and hand off work

## Project Context

### inat-observations-wp
**Tech Stack**: PHP, JavaScript, WordPress, MySQL, Docker
**Scope**: WordPress plugin for biodiversity observation data
**Key Agents**: Backend Engineer, Frontend Specialist, DevOps Engineer, QA Engineer

### ai-way
**Tech Stack**: TBD (early stage)
**Scope**: Ambitious long-term AI project
**Key Agents**: Solutions Architect, Full-Stack Developer, All specialists

## Agent Collaboration Examples

### Feature Development Flow
1. **Solutions Architect** - Design feature architecture
2. **UX/UI Designer** - Create wireframes and mockups
3. **Backend Engineer** - Build API and data layer
4. **Frontend Specialist** - Implement UI
5. **QA Engineer** - Test functionality
6. **Security Auditor** - Review for vulnerabilities
7. **Performance Optimizer** - Profile and optimize
8. **Documentation Specialist** - Document feature

### Security Review Flow
1. **Ethical Hacker** - Perform security audit
2. **Backend Engineer** - Fix backend vulnerabilities
3. **Frontend Specialist** - Fix frontend vulnerabilities
4. **Compliance Lawyer** - Review privacy/legal compliance
5. **QA Engineer** - Verify fixes
6. **Documentation Specialist** - Update security documentation

### Experimental Feature Flow
1. **Mad Scientist Intern** - Prototype wild idea
2. **Solutions Architect** - Evaluate viability
3. **Chaos Monkey Intern** - Try to break it
4. **Full-Stack Developer** - Refine for production
5. **Performance Optimizer** - Ensure it's fast enough
6. **Security Auditor** - Ensure it's secure

## Contributing

To add a new agent:

1. Create a markdown file in the appropriate category directory
2. Follow the existing agent profile structure
3. Include relevant expertise for our projects
4. Define clear use cases and working style
5. Update this README with the new agent

## License

This repository inherits the AGPL-3.0 license.

## Notes

- Agents can collaborate and hand off work between each other
- Multiple agents can work on the same task from different perspectives
- Agent profiles can evolve based on project needs
- Use the right agent for the job - don't force a backend engineer to design UX
