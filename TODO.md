### Agent Personalities
- Should agents have more defined personalities?
- Should we add humor/style preferences?
- Cultural considerations for different markets?
- Tone variations (formal, casual, technical)?

### Advanced Features
- Agent skill trees and progression
- Agent "moods" based on project phase
- Agent confidence levels for different tasks
- Agent learning from past interactions
- Agent specialization based on codebase familiarity

## Questions to Answer

- How do we measure agent effectiveness?
- Should agents have different "modes" (review vs build)?
- How do we handle agent conflicts (different opinions)?
- Should we version agents for different project stages?
- How do we deprecate outdated agents?

## Metrics to Track

- Which agents are used most frequently?
- Which agent combinations work best?
- Which agents need more refinement?
- What new agents are most requested?
- How do agent profiles evolve over time?

## Notes

- Keep agent profiles focused and specific
- Avoid overlap between agents
- Update profiles based on real usage
- Remove agents that aren't useful
- Add agents based on actual project needs, not hypotheticals
